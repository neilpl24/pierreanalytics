# WAR Write Up + Other Statistics

This README will cover my new WAR model and some other statistics that I have added to [my website](https://www.pierreanalytics.com/). If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-pierre-louis/) or my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pierreanalytics).

## Background
The combination of post-grad/pre-job boredom and the NHL deciding to do absolutely nothing with their data unlike [other leagues](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) inspired me to take on this project. Hockey is a difficult sport when it comes to quantifying what makes a player good. There are so many factors at play with so many skaters on this ice! Look at [Andrei Svechnikov's first NHL goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6wXcf8oDeA) for example. Crazy net front scrum, missed shot rolls around the boards, and Faulk shoots a snap shot that Svechnikov redirects past Georgiev.
